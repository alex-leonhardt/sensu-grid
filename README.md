# faq

#### how can I filter by more than 1 value?

Amend the URL and add all the filters together as a comma-separated list, e.g.:
http://localhost:5000/filtered/aaa,bbb,ccc,ddd

#### what do the filters filter by ?

They filter based on the hosts' subscriptions, except in the Events view where they filter on all properties of the check and the host.
